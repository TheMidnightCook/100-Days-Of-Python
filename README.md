# 100-Days-Of-Python 🐍

I enrolled in the "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022" course from Udemy.

My objective is to master Python, thus I chose this course to provide me with a structured and guided "self-learning" content.
Going through the material, I will use this repo to journal my progress and all the projects attempts.
